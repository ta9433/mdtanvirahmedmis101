      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Md Tanvir Ahmed</strong>, a resident of Folsom, California. This website was created for my MIS101 web design project. Here you’ll learn a bit about me, my family, my interests and see some of the amazing places I've explored.</p>
      <p>Feel free to browse through the pages using the navigation above. Each page highlights a different part of my life, from an introduction on the About page to details about my wife, Samira, and my passion for Argentine football. You'll also find a collection of cool photos from my travels and a way to get in touch with me.</p>
